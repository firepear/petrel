0.5.0 - 2015-01-05

  API changes

    * Socket names are no longer automagic. They are now an argument
      to New()

    * Negative timeout values now set a connection deadline in
      addition to creating a one-shot connection (e.g. -5 creates a
      one-shot conn with a 5 second deadline)

    * All dispatches now generate a Msg, not just those which fail

  Internal changes and bugfixes

    * sockAccept() and connHandler() are now part of Adminsock's
      methodset, eliminating several arguments to each

    * There is now a (preëmptive) canonical import path
