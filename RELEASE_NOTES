0.34.0 - 2022-05-07
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * Msg level `All` is now `Debug`

    * Server configuration struct is now named `Config` rather than
      `ServerConfig`

    * Client configuration struct is now named `Config` rather than
      `ClientConfig`

    * Server configuration now specifies `Msglvl` as a string, which
      is the lowercase version of the Petrel constant (e.g. "debug"
      for `Debug`). This makes application configuration, where the
      programmer shouldn't have to care about Petrel, more sane

  Nonbreaking changes

    * `golint` cleanups


0.33.0 - 2022-04-23
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * The petrel client and server are now discrete subpackages within
      the module. No code changes other than those needed to make this
      new organization work

    * See examples for updated usage; improved docs coming soon


0.32.0 - 2021-01-09
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Various other changes to be more in-line with modern Golang
      project expectations


0.31.0 - 2020-05-14
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Transition to Go module

    * Removal of `petrel.Version`; obviated by module transition

    * Renamed `petrel.Protover` to `petrel.Proto`


0.30.1 - 2017-09-30
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Code passed through 'goformat -s'. Also a few typo catches and
      similar cleanups.


0.30.0 - 2016-11-29
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Internal changes to accomodate petreljs

          * Binary encoding is now little-endian

          * Transmission marshalling has been decoupled from
            connWrite.

          * connWrite has been split into connWrite and connWriteRaw
            (the former calls the latter to do actual writing of
            data).

          * connRead has been joined by connReadRaw, which reads from
            the connection without unmarshalling the transmission
            being read. connRead does not call connReadRaw.

          * Client has a new method, DispatchRaw, which forwards
            transmissions to/from a server as-is.


0.29.0 - 2016-11-20
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * HMAC is now Base64 encoded rather than raw.


0.28.0 - 2016-11-01
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * The original demo client/server are now at demo/01-basic.

    * The basic demo client/server now have a `-hmac` argument to
      allow transmitting with MACs.

    * Transmissions now have a sequence number.

    * petrel.Client.Dispatch now returns:
          * The transmission response
          * The transmission sequence num
          * An error

    * The Petrel wire protocol now includes a 1-byte version
      identifier. A transmission with a version mismatch results in a
      terminated connection, as an HMAC mismatch does.

    * Internal names cleanup


0.27.0 - 2016-10-24
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * ServerConfig.Reqlen is now a uint32 (was int), allowing a
      maximum request size of 4GB.


0.26.0 - 2016-10-14
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Petrel now provides optional message authentication via
      crypto/HMAC

    * Server constructors renamed to match Client ones.

    * Client.Close is now Client.Quit, to match the Server shutdown
      method.

    * OmitPrefix has been removed from ClientConfig. petrel.Client now
      always sends length-prefixed messages.

    * Long manual-style godoc preamble removed in favor of more
      informative documentation for individual structs and methods.

    * Reinstated demo client and server.


0.25.0 - 2016-10-07
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Petrel and Pclient packages integrated.

      Name changes: petrel.Config   -> ServerConfig
                    pclient.Config  -> ClientConfig
                    petrel.Handler  -> petrel.Server
                    Handler.AddFunc -> Server.Register

      All constructors have been renamed (see go doc).

    * New option in ServerConfig: Reqlen, the maximum number of bytes
      which will be read for any request.

    * New option in ServerConfig: LogIP, whether to log Client IPs on
      connect or not.

    * Improvements in reliability and correctness of network handling.

    * Client now returns nil and an error when it receives an error
      response from the Server side.

    * Better consistency in messaging; efficiency improvements in Msg
      generation.

    * Long-form docs are temporarily gutted for rebuild next release.

    * Version jump: unified versions and added 1


0.22.0 - 2016-03-30
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Use qsplit.LocationsOnce for faster separation of request
      command and args


0.21.0 - 2016-03-29
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Name change: asock -> petrel

    * asock.Asock is now petrel.Handler

    * Asock.AddHandler is now Handler.AddFunc

    * Valid settings for Handler.AddFunc's second argument (mode) have
      changed from "split"/"nosplit" to "args"/"blob". This change
      means that the setting now describes its use-case instead of its
      implementation.

    * Null request and unknown command messages no longer return a
      list of known handlers. This exposed internal state. Users
      should implement their own 'help' type handler.

    * Docs rewrite.


0.20.0 - 2016-03-09
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Oneshot connection mode is gone. It was a bad idea, torturously
      implemented.

    * Constructors now take *Config instead of Config.

    * Improvements to timeout handling (func call eliminated; no more
      local var creation and time.Duration casting on every network
      operation).


0.19.1 - 2015-12-10
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Small networking improvements


0.19.0 - 2015-12-10
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * EOM is gone. All messages are now sent prefixed with their
      length in bytes as a 4 byte header.

    * pclient now used where possible for petrel test cases

    * Moved example client to the pclient package


0.18.0 - 2015-08-03
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Example server now includes a handler which returns an error.

    * Test coverage brought back up from rapid 0.16/0.17 dev cycles.

    * Documentation improvements


0.17.0 - 2015-06-18
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

      * Dispatch is no longer a public type. As a result, it no longer
        appears in constructor calls and does not have to be
        instantiated by the user.

      * DispatchFunc is no longer a public type.  Dispatch functions
        are now added to Asock instances by calling the AddHandler()
        method.

      * Docs are all kinds of wrong right now. 0.18 will fix this.


0.16.1 - 2015-06-03
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * petrel/client moved to own package, pclient


0.16.0 - 2015-06-03
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

      * Config.TLSConfig no longer exists. It is once again an
        argument of petrel.NewTLS().

      * petrel.NewUnix() has a new argument, which is the Unix
        permissions to set on the socket.

      * Aclient constructors now take a single argument, a Config
        struct, as the Asock constructors do.

      * client.Config has a new `EOM` field, which behaves identically
        to the petrel.Config field of the same name, described below.

      * The Msg generated by a.Quit being invoked (code 199) is now
        sent regardless of Msglvl setting.

      * There is a new Msg, code 401, for a null request.

  Additions and other changes

      * The petrel.Config struct has a new field, `EOM`, which sets the
        end-of-message marker (defaults to "\n\n").

      * Network handling is now more correct and robust.

      * Test suite speedups (across 0.16 and 0.15)


0.15.0 - 2015-05-26
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

      * The `Config` struct has two new fields:

          * Config.Buffer specifies the size of the buffer on the
            Asock.Msgr channel (defaults to 32).

          * Config.TLSConfig is the *tls.Config instance which is
            needed to set up a TLS connection.  This was formerly an
            argument of petrel.NewTLS().

      * The `Timeout` field in the `Config` struct is now treated as
        milliseconds instead of seconds.

      * client constructors have a new argument, `timeout`, which sets
        the number of milliseconds before read/write operations
        timeout.

  Additions and other changes

      * client has a new method, Read()

      * A special-casing of Config.Timeout for test purposes has been
        removed from the production petrel code.

      * Read buffer in petrel and client now defaults to 128 bytes (up
        from 64).


0.14.1 - 2015-05-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Documentation improvements


0.14.0 - 2015-05-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * TLS support added via the petrel & client NewTLS() methods.


0.13.0 - 2015-05-16
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * `petrel/client` package added

    * Documentation improvements


0.12.0 - 2015-03-28
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Msg now implements the error interface, so it will autostringify
      when passed to fmt.Println, log.Print, log.Fatal, etc.


0.11.1 - 2015-02-18
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Msg.Conn and Msg.Req are now uint (were int)

    * Documentation improvements


0.11.0 - 2015-02-16
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * Argmode functionality is now per Dispatch function instead of
      per petrel instance.

    * As a result, the signature of Dispatch has changed to
      'map[string]*DispatchFunc', where DispatchFunc is a new type
      which holds information about Dispatch functions.


0.10.0 - 2015-02-16
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * New Config field, Argmode. This controls how arguments to
      Dispatch functions will be handled.


0.9.0 - 2015-02-11
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * Dispatch functions are now of type
      'func([][]byte) ([]byte error)'
      Formerly the argument was '[]string'.


0.8.0 - 2015-02-10
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * Constructors now take a configuration struct rather than a long
      list of parameters

    * Unix socket names are no longer semiautomagic; sockets are now
      created exactly where Config.sockname says.


0.7.0 - 2015-01-23
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * Package name change!

    * New() is now NewUnix()

  Additions and other changes

    * Added TCP support - NewTCP()


0.6.0 - 2015-01-17
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * New() now has a 4th argument, messaging level, which controls
      which messages will be sent to a.Msgr

  Additions and other changes

    * Msg type is now far more robust, enabling better
      logging. Concommitantly, Msg.Txt is now generally more terse,
      since more information is elsewhere

    * All Msgs now have a numeric Code field, which accurately
      identifies what sort of message it is

    * A Msg is now generated when a response is sent to a client

    * Improved test coverage

  Bugfixes

    * A response is no longer sent when the request generates an error

    * Connection closures due to timeout now generate a Msg indicating
      server-side closure instead of client-side closure


0.5.1 - 2015-01-10
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Changes to match new qsplit API


0.5.0 - 2015-01-05
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Breaking changes

    * Socket names are no longer automagic. They are now an argument
      to New()

    * Negative timeout values now set a connection deadline in
      addition to creating a one-shot connection (e.g. -5 creates a
      one-shot conn with a 5 second deadline)

    * All dispatches now generate a Msg, not just those which fail

  Additions and other changes

    * sockAccept() and connHandler() are now part of Asock's
      methodset, eliminating several arguments to each

    * There is now a (preëmptive) canonical import path

    * Documentation improvements


0.4.1 - 2014-12-30
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Now 'go vet' and golint approved


0.4.0 - 2014-12-29
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Public release


0.3.0 - 2014-10-21
--------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Imported code from everydayd
