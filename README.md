# Petrel

SQLite lets programmers add reliable, structured data storage to any
program, with no hassle, low resource overhead, and no infrastructure
requirements. Petrel aims to do the same for networking.

- Optimized for programmer time
- A single program can embed multiple Petrel servers and/or clients
- Petrel servers support arbitrarily many concurrent connections
- Security-conscious design
  - TLS support for link security
  - HMAC support for message verification
  - Message length limits to protect against memory exhaustion
- No non-stdlib dependencies
- Proven mostly reliable and decently performant in real-world use!

See the [Release
notes](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
for info on updates.

# Using Petrel

For people whose learning style might be described as "code first,
then start reading when something breaks", here are links to the
[server](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/firepear/petrel/server?tab=doc)
and
[client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/firepear/petrel/client?tab=doc)
godoc. You might find reading over the
[example](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/raw/main/examples/README.md)
code helpful as well -- the `server` and `client` there are very well
commented.

For people who want more exposition before loading a buffer into the
editor, please keep reading.

## The basics

The goal of Petrel is not to replace message brokers, pub/sub systems,
or libraries like gRPC -- just as SQLite does not try to replace
high-performance RDBMSes.

Speaking as its author, What I want from Petrel is for it to be there
every time I have a thought like "Man, I'd like to be able to talk to
this over the network" or "It would be great to have a C&C channel
into this long-running process". I strive to be make it decently
useful, performant, and correct, but its origins are fundamentally as
a _sysadmin's tool._ It's glue code for the network.

- Petrel has a client/server model, in which clients `Dispatch()`
  requests to servers, and get responses in reply
- Petrel pushes raw bytes over sockets; there is no underlying library
  or service handling network traffic
- Petrel offers network security, but it does not have any concept of
  _authentication;_ that is an application-level concern
- Petrel is very unopinionated from the perspective of plugging into
  it:
  - It does not care what your data looks like; interaly everything is
    a `[]byte`, and it's up to your application to know what to do
    with the payload of a given request
  - Request handlers are just functions with the signature
    `func([]byte) (uint16, []byte, error)`
- On the other hand, it's a little bit opinionated about operations on
  the server side, in the name of taking stuff off your plate:
  - You'll need to have (or put) a simple event loop somewhere
  - You get a handler for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`, whether you wanted
    that or not


## Servers

A Petrel server wants to be hands-off. Maybe the thing you're writing
is just a wrapper around the server, but maybe the server is almost
irrelevant to your code, and exists just for occasional queries. To
support either, once a server is instantiated and handlers have been
configured, your code should be able to ignore it during normal
operation.

The simplest case of creating a server is:

```
import (
        ps "github.com/firepear/petrel/client"
)

s, err := ps.New(&ps.Config{Addr: "localhost:60606"})
if err != nil {
        // take care of oops here. also, if err != nil
        // then s == nil, and it's useless
}
```

At this point `s` is a live `server`, which is listening for
connections but doesn't know how to do anything else. To make it
useful we need to add at least one `Handler`.

### Handlers

`Handler`s are the functions which a `server` calls to _handle_
requests. To make a `Handler` callable, we `Register()` them. If we
have a function named `startsWith` which returns words from a list
that begin with a given letter, we could call

`s.Register("match", startsWith)`

And now `s` knows how to respond to clients that send `match`
requests. As you can see, `Handler`s do not need to be exported, so
long as they are in the package where the `server` is instantiated.

A `Handler` has the signature

`func([]byte) (uint16, []byte, error)`

The input and return `[]byte` are the request and response payloads,
respectively. They're very straightforward. The other two return
values are more nuanced.

When writing a `Handler`, the `error` value should always be `nil`
unless the function has an actual, unrecoverable error. Put another
way, the `error` is not a signal to the client that the request was
not successful; it is a signal to the `server` that the `Handler`
function has failed.

The `uint16` is the response status, and is covered in more detail in
the next section. As a brief explanation though, let's look at a
couple of hypothetical examples.

The short version is that if a request went perfectly and is returning the desired data, the status should be set to `200` and the data should be returned as the payload. But to indicate a non-normal result (e.g. a search which matched nothing)

### Status

Request and response status are actually part of the Petrel wire
protocol header, and they are the primary mechanism for communicating
how things are going between a client and server.

Status is represented as a `uint16`, so it takes up two bytes and has
a range of possible values from 0 (zero) to 65535, and Petrel reserves
the range 0-1024 for system use.

This does not mean that `Handler` code should never return a status of
0-1024 -- in fact, the standard response status for "success" is
`200`, just as in HTTP. What it means is that an application should
never (re)define the meaning of a status in that range.

### OS signals

Embedding a Petrel server in your code gets you handlers for `SIGINT`
and `SIGTERM`, for free. This is generally handy for long-running
processes. On the other hand, Petrel does not handle pidfiles or other
aspects of daemonization.

## Clients

Petrel clients are very lightweight. There is no concept of a
long-lived client, which can be opened and closed multiple network
connections. A client can handle any number of requests, but the
intent is that once you call `Quit()` to drop the connection, you're
done with that client and will create a new one when needed.

# Protocol

The Petrel wire protocol has a fixed 11-byte header, two run-length
encoded data segments, and an optional 44-byte HMAC segment.

    Status code       uint16 (2 bytes)
    Seqence number    uint32 (4 bytes)
    Request length    uint8  (1 byte)
    Payload length    uint32 (4 bytes)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Request text      Per request length (max 255 char)
    Payload text      Per payload length (max 4MB)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    HMAC              44 bytes, optional

Request and payload text are utf8 encoded.

HMAC is base64 utf8 text. There is no need for messages to specify
whether HMAC is included or not, as that is set by the client and
server at connection time.

# Code quality

This is a one-person project, but I take it seriously and do my best
to deliver code that is well-tested and does what I mean it to do. At
the shallow end, these badges let you know that (1) the `main` branch
builds cleanly, and (2) the project structure is sane:

![Build/test status](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)
[![GoReportCard link](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/firepear/petrel)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/firepear/petrel)

And then going a bit deeper, there's the [test coverage
report](https://firepear.github.io/petrel/assets/coverage.html), which
is generated by my `pre-commit` hook. And speaking of, that hook also
runs

- `gofmt`
- `go vet`
- `golangci-lint`
- `staticcheck`

So I can't make a single commit if my tests or those tools see a
failure. That doesn't mean no bugs, but it does mean the code is free
of a lot of bad smells, as well as any bugs that I've seen before.

## Running tests

If you want to run the tests yourself, either just run
`./assets/runcover` or look at it to see how I'm running the tests --
they will fail if run with just `go test ./...`
