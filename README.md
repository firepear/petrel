# Petrel

_This module is pre-v1; expect frequent breaking changes._

SQLite embeds serverless relational databases into programs. Petrel
lets you do the same with networking and RPC.

- Optimized for programmer time
- A program can embed multiple Petrel servers and/or clients
- Petrel servers support arbitrarily many concurrent connections
  - But individual connections are synchronous
- Works over Unix domain sockets or TCP
- Security-conscious design
  - TLS support for link security and/or client authentication
  - HMAC support for message verification
  - Message length limits to protect against memory exhaustion,
- No external dependencies
- Proven mostly reliable and decently performant in real-world use!

See the [Release
notes](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
for updates.

# Wire protocol

The Petrel wire protocol has a fixed 11-byte header, two run-length
encoded data segments, and an optional 44-byte HMAC segment.

    Status code       uint16 (2 bytes)
    Seqence number    uint32 (4 bytes)
    Request length    uint8  (1 byte)
    Payload length    uint32 (4 bytes)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Request text      Per request length (max 255 char)
    Payload text      Per payload length (max 4MB)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    HMAC              44 bytes, optional

There is no need for messages to specify whether HMAC is included or
not, as that is set by the client and server at connection time.

# Server

## Signal handling

Embedding a Petrel server in your code gets you handlers for `SIGINT`
and `SIGTERM`, for free. At the moment, Petrel does not handle
pidfiles.
