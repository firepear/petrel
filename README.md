# petrel

Petrel is a non-HTTP toolkit for adding network capabilities to
programs. With it you can define APIs/RPCs of arbitrary complexity,
using any data format you like. Here are some key features:

- Optimized for programmer ease-of-use, but has been proven decently
  performant in real-world datacenter use.

- Supports command-line style requests (automatic tokenization, like
  ARGV), or blob style request handling (raw payload passed through to
  your code).

- Works over Unix domain sockets or TCP.

- Security-conscious design:

  - TLS support for link security and/or client authentication.

  - HMAC support for message verification.

  - Message length limits to protect against memory exhaustion,
    accidental or purposeful

- Petrel has no external dependencies, and passes `golint`,
  `go vet`, and `go test -race` cleanly.

## Example

See the demo [server](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/blob/master/examples/basic/example-server.go) and
[client](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/blob/master/examples/basic/example-client.go) for
worked examples of Petrel usage.

To see them in action, in one terminal in the basic example directory,
do `go run example-server.go` to start the example server.

Then in another terminal, try a few runs of the client:

```
go run demo/example-client.go time
go run demo/example-client.go echo whatever you feel like typing here
go run demo/example-client.go
go run demo/example-client.go foobar
```

When you're done, kill the server with `C-c` in its terminal.
