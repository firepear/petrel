# Petrel

SQLite lets programmers add reliable, structured data storage to any
program, with no hassle, low resource overhead, and no infrastructure
requirements. Petrel aims to do the same for networking.

- Optimized for programmer time
- A single program can embed multiple Petrel servers and/or clients
- Petrel servers support arbitrarily many concurrent connections
- Security-conscious design
  - TLS support for link security
  - HMAC support for message verification
  - Message length limits to protect against memory exhaustion
- No non-stdlib dependencies
- Proven mostly reliable and decently performant in real-world use!

See the [Release
notes](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
for info on updates.

# Using Petrel

For people whose learning style might be described as "code first,
then start reading when something breaks", here are links to the
[server](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/firepear/petrel/server?tab=doc)
and
[client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/firepear/petrel/client?tab=doc)
godoc. You might find reading over the
[example](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/raw/main/examples/README.md)
code helpful as well -- the `server` and `client` there are very well
commented.

For people who want more exposition before loading a buffer into the

## The basics

The goal of Petrel is not to replace message brokers, pub/sub systems,
or libraries like gRPC -- just as SQLite does not try to replace
high-performance RDBMSes.

Speaking as its author, What I want from Petrel is for it to be there
every time I have a thought like "Man, I'd like to be able to talk to
this over the network" or "It would be great to have a C&C channel
into this long-running process". I strive to be make it decently
useful, performant, and correct, but its origins are fundamentally as
a _sysadmin's tool._ It's glue code for the network.

- Petrel has a client/server model, in which clients `Dispatch()`
  requests to servers, and get responses in reply
- Petrel pushes raw bytes over sockets; there is no underlying library
  or service handling network traffic
- Petrel offers network security, but it does not have any concept of
  _authentication;_ that is an application-level concern
- Petrel is very unopinionated from the perspective of plugging into
  it:
  - It does not care what your data looks like; interaly everything is
    a `[]byte`, and it's up to your application to know what to do
    with the payload of a given request
  - Request handlers are just functions with the signature
    `func([]byte) (uint16, []byte, error)`
- On the other hand, it's a little bit opinionated about operations on
  the server side, in the name of taking stuff off your plate:
  - You'll need to have (or put) a simple event loop somewhere
  - You get a handler for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`, whether you wanted
    that or not


## Servers

A Petrel server wants to be hands-off. Maybe the thing you're writing
is just a wrapper around the server, but maybe the server is almost
irrelevant to your code, and exists just for occasional queries. To
support either, once a server is instantiated and handlers have been
configured, your code should be able to ignore it during normal
operation.

The simplest case of creating a server is:

```
import (
        ps "github.com/firepear/petrel/client"
)

s, err := ps.New(&ps.Config{Addr: "localhost:60606"})
if err != nil {
        // take care of oops here
}
```

At this point `s` is a live `server`, which is listening for
connections but doesn't know how to do anything else. To make it
useful we need to add at least one `Handler`.

### Handlers

`Handler`s are the functions which a `server` calls to _handle_
requests. To make a `Handler` callable, we `Register()` them. If we
have a function named `startsWith` which returns words from a list
that begin with a given letter, we could call

`s.Register("matches", startsWith)`

And now `s` knows how to respond to clients that send `matches`
requests. Two things of note:

- `Handler` funcs do not need to be exported so long as they are in
  the package where the `server` is instantiated
- The registered label for a request (`matches` in this example) has
  no relation to the function name

A `Handler` has the signature `func([]byte) (uint16, []byte, error)`

The input and return `[]byte` are the request and response payloads,
respectively. The other two return values are more nuanced.

When writing a `Handler`, the `error` value should always be `nil`
unless the function experiences an actual and unrecoverable error. To
put it another way, the `error` is not a signal to the client that the
request was non-normal; it is a signal to the `server` that the
`Handler` function has failed.

The `uint16` is the response status, and is covered in more detail in
the next section.

### Status

Request and response status are actually part of the Petrel wire
protocol header, and they are the primary mechanism for communicating
how things are going between a client and server.

Status is represented as a `uint16`, so it takes up two bytes and has
a range of possible values from 0 (zero) to 65535, and Petrel reserves
the range 0-1024 for system use.

This does not mean that `Handler` code should never return a status of
0-1024 -- in fact, the standard response status for "success" is
`200`, just as in HTTP. What it means is that an application should
never (re)define the meaning of a status in that range. Let's look at
a couple of examples.

In the previous section we mentioned a hypothetical `Handler` func
named `startsWith` which takes a single letter as an input and returns
a list of words which start with that letter. Let's say that its
complete list of words to check is pretty small:

`["apple", "boy", "bat", "dog"]`

If a client sends a request for words starting with `a`, we might
return

`return 200, []byte("apple"), nil`

But if a client requests words starting with `n`, there are no
matches. This is not an error condition from the `Handler` point of
view; the code executed successfully, but there is nothing to
return. We might indicate returning status 200 and an empty payload:

`return 200, []byte{}, nil`

But this feels ambiguous. It might be better to design our app such
that a given status indicates "no matches" and use the payload to
provide more information:

`return 9101, []byte(fmt.Sprintf("no matches for %s"), letter), nil`

We might want something with even more structure, and design a JSON
struct which can encode all the information our app might need to
convey for any given response. That's easy, since Petrel treats all
payloads as slices of bytes and leaves it up to application code to
parse and/or assemble those bytes. But that's getting off-topic.


### Monitoring and keepalive

If `Handler` funcs almost always return `nil` for their `error` value,
and application code is not involved in the dispatch of requests and
responses, how can we know what's going on with the `server`?

First, the `server` will generate `log` messages, as many pieces of
server software do. These messages print to `stderr`, the default
destination of the `log` package. You can control which messages are
logged by setting the `Loglvl` attribute in the `server.Config` struct
which gets passed to `New()`.

NB: In the next release (v0.40), an option to direct Petrel logs to a
specific file will be added. An option to add a custom prefix to
logged messages may also be added. Right now, however, neither is
possible.

Second is the keepalive and/or event loop. `server` exports a channel
called `Shutdown`. When a `server` encounters a shutdown condition
(fatal error, trapped OS signal, etc.) a single `petrel.Msg` will be
sent over this channel. Your code should be watching it in order to
know when/if something happens to the server. A minimal case for doing
this might look like:

```
keepalive := true
for keepalive {
	select {
	case msg := <-s.Shutdown:
		log.Println("app event loop:", msg)
		keepalive = false
		break
	}
}
```

This is taken directly from `examples/server/basic-server.go`, where
you can see it with many comments added if you'd like more insight
into what's going on. But this is just an example, and the only
important thing is to somehow keep an eye on `s.Shutdown` so that you
can take appropriate steps when a `Msg` shows up there.

### OS signals

Embedding a Petrel server in your code gets you handlers for `SIGINT`
and `SIGTERM`, for free. This is generally handy for long-running
processes. On the other hand, Petrel does not handle pidfiles or other
aspects of daemonization.

When either of them is trapped, the `server` will wait for all
connections to close, then shut itself down. This will trigger a
message on `s.Shutdown`, which should be intercepted as described
above.

## Clients

Petrel clients are very lightweight. There is no concept of a
long-lived client, which can be opened and closed multiple network
connections. A client can handle any number of requests, but the
intent is that once you call `Quit()` to drop the connection, you're
done with that client and will create a new one when needed.

# Protocol

The Petrel wire protocol has a fixed 11-byte header, two run-length
encoded data segments, and an optional 44-byte HMAC segment.

    Status code       uint16 (2 bytes)
    Seqence number    uint32 (4 bytes)
    Request length    uint8  (1 byte)
    Payload length    uint32 (4 bytes)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Request text      Per request length (max 255 char)
    Payload text      Per payload length (max 4MB)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    HMAC              44 bytes, optional

Request and payload text are utf8 encoded.

HMAC is base64 utf8 text. There is no need for messages to specify
whether HMAC is included or not, as that is set by the client and
server at connection time.

# Code quality

This is a one-person project, but I take it seriously and do my best
to deliver code that is well-tested and does what I mean it to do. At
the shallow end, these badges let you know that (1) the `main` branch
builds cleanly, and (2) the project structure is sane:

![Build/test status](https://github.com/firepear/petrel/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)
[![GoReportCard link](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/firepear/petrel)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/firepear/petrel)

And then going a bit deeper, there's the [test coverage
report](https://firepear.github.io/petrel/assets/coverage.html), which
is generated by my `pre-commit` hook. And speaking of, that hook also
runs

- `gofmt`
- `go vet`
- `golangci-lint`
- `staticcheck`

So I can't make a single commit if my tests or those tools see a
failure. That doesn't mean no bugs, but it does mean the code is free
of a lot of bad smells, as well as any bugs that I've seen before.

## Running tests

If you want to run the tests yourself, either just run
`./assets/runcover` or look at it to see how I'm running the tests --
they will fail if run with just `go test ./...`
